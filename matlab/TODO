- Develop alternate solution based on explicit Lanczos + Tridiagonal solving
For Tridiagonal solving, use cheap storage and solution
Since we will use partial Lanczos, we then need to convert solution to original space
To implement Lanczos we have several options, but in all we might want preconditioning
- 2 term simple
- 3 term simple
- with full reorthonormalization (householder)
